## üìÑ Documentation

The circuits are described in configuration files (.nts) found in the Circuits directory.

Available commands in simulator mode:

- `display`: Display the current state of pins
- `simulate`: Simulate a clock tick
- `loop`: Run simulation continuously
- `exit`: Exit the program

For detailed component specifications and examples, please refer to the Documentations directory.

## üîó Dependencies

- C++ compiler supporting C++20
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/fr/) (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphical interface

## üìÇ Sources

The project is organized as follows:

- `Bonus`: The base for the bonus visual editor
- `Circuits`: Circuit definition files (.nts)
- `Components`: Base implementation of circuit components
- `Documentations`: Documentation for components
- `Errors`: Custom error exception
- `External`: External libraries such as SFML and ImGui
- `Gates`: Basic implementation of logical gates
- `Sequencials`: Basic implementation of sequencial component
- `Shell`: Command interface implementation
- `Specials`: Specials components such as Input/Output
- `Tests`: Test cases for the project
